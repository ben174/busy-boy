## What is this?

The GitHub contribution graph is a handy quick glance at the activity of a
user on GitHub. But you can easily game it by altering your commit dates.
When I learned about this, I created <a
href="https://github.com/ben174/git-draw">GitDraw</a> to have some fun and
allow people to draw pictures in their contribution graph.

But as someone who has been a decision maker in the hiring process for quite
some time now, I still sometimes find myself biasing at least part of my
decision on my first glance at their GitHub contribution graph. Knowing how
easy it is to game, I consider this a vulnerability in the hiring process.
And with vulnerabilities, often times bringing attention to them is what it
takes to teach people not to rely on them.

So here is a tool which will allow anyone to fudge contribution activity.

## Usage

Use the tools below to create a contribution graph of your liking. Once you've
created your graph, use the Download Script button to generate a bash script
which will initialize a new repo and provision the commits necessary to output
this exact contribution graph on your GitHub profile.

### Steps
1. Create your commit graph.
1. Click the Download Script button
1. Create a repo called 'gf' on GitHub.
1. Execute the script.
1. Change directory to 'gf' and push the repo.
